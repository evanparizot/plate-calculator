# Plate Calculator

* https://www.platecalculator.net

I made this site because I was tired/too lazy to calculate how much weight to
put on a barbell when lifting. This app just takes in an input weight in pounds
or kilograms and tells you how many plates you should load. It can handle plates 
in either pounds or kilograms as well. Some things that still need to be added:

* Barbell selection (Safety, Swiss, etc...)
* Dark Mode
